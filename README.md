## About

BOLD-CLI lets you download specimen and sequence data from the barcode of life database (BOLD) directly from the command line. BOLD-CLI interfaces with the database via the [BOLD API](http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/resources/api?type=webservices) and allows you to obtain local copies of data without needing to utilize [the public data portal](http://www.boldsystems.org/index.php/Public_BINSearch?searchtype=records). The command line interface provides an efficient means of querying the database and also allows returned data to be directly piped to other UNIX shell commands. 

## Installation

To use BOLD-CLI, download the executable file (*COMING SOON*) in this repository for your operating system (Windows, Mac and Linux provided). Make sure the executable is located on your [PATH](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)) or within your working directory and then you should be ready to roll. Test that it is working by running the command: `bold-cli -h` from the command line/command prompt.

Or if you have go installed on your computer and your GOPATH is properly configured, you can install the program directly from the command line:
```
go get github.com/CNuge/BOLD-CLI
go install github.com/CNuge/BOLD-CLI
```

## Example usage
```
bold-cli -o salp_barcodes.fasta -query sequence -taxon salvelinus alpinus

bold-cli -query specimen -output test.tsv -taxon Aves -geo Florida -format tsv
```
- Default output is the combined summary and sequence data in tsv format.
```
bold-cli -taxon Aves -geo Florida
```
- Can use multiple arguments for one paramater from command line, just comma delimit them.
```
bold-cli -query specimen -output test2.tsv -taxon Aves,Reptilia -geo Florida -format tsv
```
- Or use multiple arguments for one paramater by passing in a text file, with each option listed on a separate line.
```
bold-cli -query sequence -output test3.fasta -taxon ./example_data/taxon_test.txt -geo Ontario -marker COI-5P
```
- Send results to standard output as opposed to files. Can then be piped to other things. Note if you have paramaters with spaces in them (i.e. drosophila melanogaster) put this last in the command query, or a text file for input.
```
bold-cli -query specimen -print -taxon drosophila melanogaster  
```
- The `-print` flag can be added to a query to send data to standard output instead of to a file. Below is an example use of pipe functionality that counts the number of COI drosophila sequences in the bold database.
```
bold-cli -query sequence -taxon drosophila -marker COI-5P -print | grep -c "^>"
```
